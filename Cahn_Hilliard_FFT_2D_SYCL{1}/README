/******************
 * C code for precipitate evolution. 
 * It solves Allen-Cahn and Cahnâ€“Hilliard equations using FFTW3. 
 * 
 * Compile the code using "make". Compilation creates "microsim_ch_fft" file. 
 * To use TDB file as input for Gibbs energy expressions, execute "python3 GEdata_writer.py Input.in" 
 * If TDB file input is not considered or the files with Gibbs energy functions are  
 * already generated then proceed for the execution of the code by  
 * Execute "./microsim_ch_fft Input.in Filling.in output" 
 * 
 * Authors: Dasari Mohan and M P Gururajan
 * 
 * This is alpha version of the code and check for updates in future release.
